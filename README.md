### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

On this challenge, I learned how to effectively use flexbox, rendering me quicker results. Since the last challenge, I have adjusted my units to include em and rem instead of pixels.

I also learned how to link svg icons into my button properties. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to use flexbox on all future projects, as well as try to incorporate and practice some grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me visualize and simplified flexbox tremendously.
